The air freight leverage is expected to be offset by approximately 200 basis points of continued inflationary cost deleverage. ROD as a percentage of sales is expected to be flat compared to last year.\n\u2022 While the company is taking actions to balance its assortment and right size inventory, the company has seen the most significant variability in its discount rate.

Performance was driven by improvement in category mix balance and assortment balance offset by softness in the kids and baby category.\n\u2022 Global comparable sales were up 4%. North America comparable sales were flat.\nBanana Republic:\n\u2022 Net sales of $517 million were up 8% compared to last year. The brand has maintained its focus on delivering quality product through a differentiated experience.

While the brand continues to make progress in driving awareness and establishing authority in the women\u2019s active and wellness category, it continued to experience softness related to the shift in consumer preference from athleisure to occasion and work-based categories consistent with the broader athleisure market.\n\u2022 Comparable sales were flat. Fiscal Year 2022 Outlook\n\u201cWhile our third quarter results underscore the initial progress we are making toward rebalancing our assortments and reducing inventories, we continue to take a prudent approach in light of the uncertain consumer and increasingly promotional environment as we look to the remainder of fiscal 2022\u201d, said Katrina O\u2019Connell, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Gap Inc. \u201cIn the near-term, we remain focused on the actions necessary to reduce inventory, rebalance our assortments to better meet changing consumer needs, aggressively manage and reevaluate our investments, and fortify our balance sheet. While we have work to do, we believe we are taking the right steps in order to position Gap Inc. for sustainable, profitable growth and to deliver value for our shareholders over the long term.\u201d\nThe company is providing the following commentary related to its outlook. Sales:\n\u2022 While the company is making progress balancing its assortments, it continues to take a prudent approach in light of the uncertain consumer and increasingly promotional environment as it relates to its sales outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2022. The company anticipates that total company net sales could be down mid-single digits year-over-year in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022.\nGross Margin and Inventory:\n\u2022 As previously communicated, the company anticipates that air freight expense will continue to normalize and as it anniversaries approximately $245 million of incremental air freight investment in the fourth quarter of last year, the company expects roughly 540 basis points of margin leverage in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. The air freight leverage is expected to be offset by approximately 200 basis points of continued inflationary cost deleverage. ROD as a percentage of sales is expected to be flat compared to last year.\n\u2022 While the company is taking actions to balance its assortment and right size inventory, the company has seen the most significant variability in its discount rate. Further limiting near-term discount rate visibility is the uncertain consumer environment and increasingly promotional\n \nenvironment. Gross margin in both the second and third quarters of fiscal 2022 was impacted by\napproximately 370 basis points of deleverage stemming primarily from higher discounting.\n\u2022 The company continues to target total inventories below prior year levels by the end of fiscal\n2022 as a result of its inventory actions, reduction of receipts, and anniversary of higher in- transit levels last year. By Spring, the company expects to begin to capitalize on its responsive levers, providing the flexibility to better align inventory levels with demand trends.\nSG&A:\n\u2022 During the third quarter, the company took initial action to reduce operating expenses, resulting in approximately $250 million in annualized savings, of which an immaterial amount will be a benefit in the fourth quarter due to timing and severance offsets in addition to anticipated headwinds in the fourth quarter related to higher seasonal labor costs relative to last year.\n\u2022 While the company\u2019s operating expense reduction actions are expected to benefit fiscal 2023, the savings are expected to be offset by more normalized incentive compensation and continued higher wage pressure next year.\nTax:\n\u2022 The cumulative tax benefit recorded year-to-date in fiscal 2022 is not expected to have an impact on the full year, as it is expected to be fully offset with tax expense in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022.\nCapital Expenditures:\n\u2022 The company continues to expect capital expenditures of approximately $650 million in fiscal 2022.\nOther:\n\u2022 As part of its 350-store closure plan, the company has closed a net total of 29 Gap and Banana Republic stores in North America year-to-date and expects to close approximately 30 more in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. The company is on track to open about 30 net new Athleta stores in fiscal year 2022. The company now expects to open approximately 10 net new Old Navy stores in fiscal year 2022; this excludes the 24 Old Navy Mexico stores which were transferred to a franchisee in the third quarter of this year.\n\u2022 As previously communicated, the company has completed its goal of offsetting dilution in fiscal 2022 and does not anticipate further share repurchases for the remainder of the year.\nWebcast and Conference Call Information\nCammeron McLaughlin, Head of Investor Relations at Gap Inc., will host a conference call to review the company\u2019s third quarter fiscal 2022 results beginning at approximately 2:00 p.m. Pacific Time today.

A replay of the webcast will be available at the same location.\n \nNon-GAAP Disclosure\nThis press release includes financial measures that have not been calculated in accordance\nwith U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and are therefore referred to as non-GAAP financial measures. The non-GAAP measures described below are intended to provide investors with additional useful information about the company\u2019s financial performance, to enhance the overall understanding of its past performance and future prospects and to allow for greater transparency with respect to important metrics used by management for financial and operating decision-making. The company presents these non-GAAP financial measures to assist investors in seeing its financial performance from management's view and because it believes they provide an additional tool for investors to use in computing the company's core financial performance over multiple periods with other companies in its industry. Additional information regarding the intended use of each non-GAAP measure included in this press release is provided in the tables to this press release.\nThe non-GAAP measures included in this press release are adjusted gross margin, adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted net income, adjusted income taxes, adjusted diluted earnings per share, and free cash flow. These non-GAAP measures exclude the impact of certain items that are set forth in the tables to this press release.\nThe non-GAAP measures used by the company should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP and may not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies due to possible differences in method and in items or events being adjusted. The company urges investors to review the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures included in the tables to this press release below, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate its business. The non-GAAP financial measures used by the company have limitations in their usefulness to investors because they have no standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and are not prepared under any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release and related conference call and webcast contain forward-looking statements within the \u201csafe harbor\u201d provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
